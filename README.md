# Task :- 01
# A Tic Tac Toe Game

## Description:
This Python program implements a two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, where players take turns marking spaces with their respective symbols ('X' or 'O'). The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If all spaces are filled without any player achieving three in a row, the game ends in a draw.

## Features:
1. Print Board: Displays the current state of the game board.
2. Check Winner: Determines if there is a winner by checking rows, columns, and diagonals for three consecutive marks of the same player.
3. Check Draw: Checks if the game board is completely filled, indicating a draw if no winner is found.
4. Player Input: Prompts players to enter row and column coordinates for their moves and validates the input.
5. Game Loop: Continuously prompts players for their moves until a winner is determined or the game ends in a draw.

## How to Play:
1. Run the Python program.
2. Players take turns entering row and column coordinates for their moves when prompted.
3. The program checks for a winner or a draw after each move.
4. The game ends when a player wins or when the board is full without a winner.
